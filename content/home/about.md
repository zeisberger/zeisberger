# Biography

Why do investors, even financial professionals, often make sub-optimal decisions? And what can we do about it?

A large part of the answer can be found in psychology. I conduct fundamental as well as practically relevant research in investor psychology ("behavioral finance") and use my insights to consult banks and insurance companies improving their products and services. Primarily, I develop and implement innovative methods to measure and assess the risk preferences of investors (“risk profiling”), taking into account the ongoing digitalization in the financial industry.
